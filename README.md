# password-generator

 Randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so  that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

This is the site:
[Github](https://latifah2022.github.io/password-generator/)

#Acceptance Criteria

I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

I select which criteria to include in the password

 I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

My input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

 A password is generated that matches the selected criteria

 the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
